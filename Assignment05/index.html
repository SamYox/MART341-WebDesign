            1. "When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love."<br />

2. "You have power over your mind â€” not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."<br />

3. "Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them. Think constantly on the changes of the elements into each other, for such thoughts wash away the dust of earthly life."<br />

4. "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."<br />

5. "Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."<br />

6. "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."<br />

7. "How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it."<br />

8. "The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury."<br />

9. "Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart."<br />

10. "The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts."<br />
