This is my webpage using the skills we have learned in week 6.

The training wheels really came off this week and I feel like I was taking the lead on my own. 

The webpage has body elements, semantic markups, lists, external hyperlinks, notes in the code, and attributes. 

I also use correct indentation and tag nesting in my code.

This enhances readability and makes mistakes more easy to correct.
