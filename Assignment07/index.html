    <h1>A Brief History of Stoic Philiosophy</h1>
        <p>Stoicism was one of the dominant philosophical systems of the Hellenistic period. The name derives from the porch <i>(stoa poikilê)</i> in the <dfn title=" The Agora was in ancient times the business, political, and legal center of Athens, bringing together citizens and foreigners, litigants and jurors, and merchants and philosophers.">Agora</dfn> at Athens decorated with mural paintings, where the first generation of Stoic philosophers congregated and lectured. The school of thought founded there long outlived the physical Athenian porch and notably enjoyed continued popularity in the Roman period and beyond.</p>

   <blockquote>
  “The chief task in life is simply this:<br/> to identify and separate matters <br/>so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals<br/> not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.<br/> Where then do I look for good and evil?<br/> Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself <br/>to the choices that are my own…”<br/> – Epictetus

      <h2>10 Bits of Stoic Wisdom</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>“Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be One.” – Marcus Aurelius</li>
            <li>“Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead man, see what’s left as a bonus and live it according to Nature. Love the hand that fate deals you and play it as your own, for what could be more fitting?” – Marcus Aurelius</li>
            <li>“It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” – Marcus Aurelius</li>
            <li>“In your actions, don’t procrastinate. In your conversations, don’t confuse. In your thoughts, don’t wander. In your soul, don’t be passive or aggressive. In your life, don’t be all about business.” – Marcus Aurelius</li>
            <li>“If it is not right, do not do it, if it is not true, do not say it.” – Marcus Aurelius</li>
            <li>“We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more in imagination than in reality.” – Seneca</li>
            <li>“Life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future.” – Seneca</li>
            <li>“I judge you unfortunate because you have never lived through misfortune. You have passed through life without an opponent—no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you.” – Seneca</li>
            <li>K“Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.”- Epictetus</li>
