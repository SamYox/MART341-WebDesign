            <h1>Lyrics</h1>
            <p>Well I met her on a freight train in the south<br />
            Rolled up cigarette hangin from her mouth<br />
            Nothin to do but sit and watch this town roll by sit and wait<br />
            Out there that boxcars hittin this road now<br />
            Out of the yard and out of town<br />
            Oh high ball whistle engineer get out of here no time to waste</p>
            <p>Dirty kid ragg!</p>
            <p>Well an ol’ bottle of whisky and a brown paper bag<br />
            Oh good luck sister, go break a leg<br />
            But don’t lose yer limbs to that ol’ freight train<br />
            It’s a rich mans world but its for good</p>
            <p>I met him on the ghetto side of town<br />
            He was drinking a 40 ounce<br />
            He sure knows how to live<br />
            Getting drunk underneath a bridge<br />
            You got a lotta time to waste when you ain’t getting wasted<br />
            Not a penny to spare when you ain’t getting paid<br />
            x3</p>
            <p>Nothing is free but freedom itself<br />
            So take another bottle off that dusty old shelf<br />
            Let’s drink to the sunset and repeat for mother earth,<br />
            The out bound freight trains and all them pretty birds<br />
            x2</p>
            <p>Let’s dance let’s dance let’s dance let’s dance let’s dance in the name of dirt<br />
            Let’s see how much how much how much our lives are really worth<br />
            Let’s dance let’s dance let’s dance let’s dance let’s dance in the light of the moon<br />
            Me and you<br />
            x2</p>
            <p>An ol’ bottle of whiskey and a brown paper bag<br />
            Oh good luck brother, go break a leg<br />
            But don’t loose a limb to that old freight train<br />
            It’s a rich man’s world but it’s for good<br />
            Dirty kid ragg!</p>
